# Movies
 Creates a file with the names of the films in this directory

All the movies with this extension:
  - "*.mkv|*.avi|*.mp4|*.flv"
The final file with the list will have this name:
  - "ListaMovies-{0}.txt"
  - "{0}" is the date when the file was created with the format "yyyyMMddHHmm".

For example:
  ListaMovies-201906152038.txt

Q&A:
1) Why is the extension movie files not the file types in a config file?
Becasue I only use this extensions and no more.
If you want more movie extesion, the configuration is inside the program.

2) Why the final file name is not in a config file?
Because I didn'y needed to change it.
